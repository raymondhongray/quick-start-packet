## How To Use ##
This packet is dessigend to be as easy as posibble to use.  
Once you install the docker and docker-compose ,  
only two more step is required to build whole services.

### Step 1 ###
Install docker and docker-compose on your machine.

[Docker ToolBox for Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/)

[Docker for Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04)
and
[Docker Compose for Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-16-04)

### Step 2 ###
Clone this project.  
Copy .env.example into .env ,then modify the variable which is ```required``` type in .env
```
git clone git@github.com:BOLT-Protocol/quick-start-packet.git 
cd quick-start-packet
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

### Step 3 ###
Start all services.
```
docker-compose up -d
```

User could observe the process by using docker-compose
```
docker-compose logs -f
```
or using docker
```
docker logs -f container-name
```

### NOTE ###
There are two type of variable in .env

For the ```required``` variable, you ```must``` provide the proper value.

For the ```optional``` variable, you could leave it as blank and system will import the default setting automatically.

While define the variable ,variable name ```SHOULD NOT``` followd by space and the equal symbol(```=```) also ```NOT``` followed by space.

```
# Correct
POA_SIGNER_PRI_KEY=1234

# Incorrect
POA_SIGNER_PRI_KEY =1234

# Incorrect
POA_SIGNER_PRI_KEY= 1234
```

The default value of ```optional``` variable:
```
# The private key of geth poa signer
POA_SIGNER_PRI_KEY=22b8af6522a7cf410b54eb8be2969c2ee20d30e89a1a2dc5476a8cccc1be8592

# The address of geth poa signer
POA_SIGNER_ADDRESS=0x9644fb7d0108a6B7e52cab5171298969a427CaCD

# The password of geth poa signer
POA_SIGNER_PWD=123qwe456RTY
